## Introduction

SCAT DAO is a new audit paradigm that reinvents the way audits are selected, performed, and financed. With SCAT DAO we solve audits inherent problem, the conflict of interest that comes from paying for an audit service. As we have seen with Enron, Tyco, and countless others, the possibility always exists for an auditor to commit fraud to keep their client happy. With SCAT DAO, the token holders choose the projects they care for and want audited. The audit process is standardized, automated, and performed by the community with all services funded by the DAO's treasury. SCAT DAO auditors are incentivized only to provide accurate audit results, regardless of if they are good or bad. No more altering or softening results to appease clients, no more worrying about what the client will think. We are the client, we are the auditor, we are SCAT DAO.

With our funding received from R5, we are currently in the process of developing our work program to audit the various dapps and projects that will be coming to the Cardano ecosystem. As part of this initiative, we will also be onboarding a work force of part time auditors who will perform audit procedures on behalf of the DAO. We believe there are direct synergies between this project already in progress and the monitoring and review of Catalyst projects, so that incorporating this into our mandate would be a good use of the communities funds as well as improve the utility and usefulness of our DAO.

As mentioned, SCAT DAO does not receive funding from any project that we audit. We feel that this is a direct conflict of interest that puts into question the legitimacy of any audit results that are found. In order to solve for this, the DAO will be issuing a token that is partially reserved by its treasury and invested into various yield generating opportunities that generate revenue and fund its operations. Eventually, we expect our treasury to be able to fund our audits as well as our monitoring of Catalyst projects, but it will take a bit of time to get to that point. To begin reviewing these sooner we are requesting additional funds that can be used to compensate our workforce that will be monitoring Catalyst projects until the treasury funding is robust and self-sustaining. All results of our monitoring will be written up into clear, easy to read reports, and will be distributed for the entire community through our website (SCATDAO.com).
